          We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our

          some of the features offered on the App, you may be asked to provide
          certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail
          address).

        <h4>Data breach</h4>
        <p>
          In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and
          Services has been compromised or Users’ Personal Information has been
          disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
          including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve
          the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not
          limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to
          and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a
          data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected
          individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to
          the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required
          by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the Website.
        </p>
        <h4>Privacy of children</h4>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children
          under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not
          submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. If
          you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has
          provided Personal Information to us through the Website and Services,
          please contact us to request that we delete that child’s Personal
          Information from our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s
          Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their
          children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and
          Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and
          legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary
          precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give
          out Personal Information when online without their permission.
        </p>

          owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible
          for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We
          encourage you to be aware when you leave the App and Services and to
          read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may
          collect Personal Information.
        </p>
